# Arduino Web Page Controller
Hello! This repo was originally created to store some Pre-COVID CHC Robotics club Code. Now, it houses a complete web-based controller for a tethered robot. This controller can be used for a variety of projects, and even features image recognition just to show off the capabilities of the project.


# Why is this Useful?:
    This project may be useful to you if you want to have two-way communication between you and the arduino from an easy-to-access point. Plus, the project is fairly easy to understand if you understand some basic C++, so you can apply it to any robotics project if you so desire.
